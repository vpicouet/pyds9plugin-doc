pyDS9plugin is the first open source pythonic [SAOImageDS9](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9) quick look plugin.

SAOImage DS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application. Its 30 years of development has made it very stable and easy to use. This made it an essential tool in all fields of astronomy (observation, simulation, instrumentation). Much more profitable but pretty unsung feature, its extensibility makes it a limitless tool to interact with astronomical data. This extensibility did not generate a large collaborative and well organized effort to develop important extensions that could progressively converge towards a stable/rapid/configurable multi-extension DS9 package.

Because I am convince of its interest, this extension is a very naive attempt to try initiate this tendency and explore the different possibilities.

The goal is the pyds9plugin is then three-fold:

- Boosting the way we interact with scientific images in a quantitative way to earn important time
- Try to bring the visualization software DS9 a step further by combining it to image processing tools
- Create a code collaboration catalyst by providing a first extensive package gathering a glimpse of all the possibilities that offers DS9 extensibility
